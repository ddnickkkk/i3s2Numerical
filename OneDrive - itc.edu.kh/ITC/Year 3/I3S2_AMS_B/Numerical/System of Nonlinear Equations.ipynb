    "# Literature Review: Newton-Raphson Method for Systems of Nonlinear Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Newton-Raphson method is a popular iterative method used for finding the roots of nonlinear equations. It can be extended to solve systems of nonlinear equations that cannot be solved analytically. In this literature review, we explore the mathematical background, advantages, limitations, and applications of the Newton-Raphson method for systems of nonlinear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Newton-Raphson method for systems of nonlinear equations involves an iterative process that approximates the solution to a system of equations by solving a linear system of equations at each iteration. The method requires an initial guess of the solution, and it converges quickly to the exact solution under certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "The Newton-Raphson method has several advantages over other iterative methods. It has a fast convergence rate, quadratic convergence, and the ability to handle both nonlinear and linear equations. It is also computationally efficient and robust, making it a preferred method for solving nonlinear systems of equations in various fields, such as engineering, physics, and finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The Newton-Raphson method has some limitations that must be considered. It is sensitive to the initial guess of the solution, which may lead to divergence or slow convergence. It also requires the computation of the Jacobian matrix, which can be computationally expensive for large systems of equations. Additionally, the method may fail to converge if the Jacobian matrix is singular or ill-conditioned, which may require the use of other numerical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The Newton-Raphson method for systems of nonlinear equations has various applications, such as solving power flow equations in electrical power systems, solving chemical equilibrium problems, and finding the steady-state solutions in control systems. It is also used in optimization problems, such as finding the minimum or maximum of a function by solving its first-order optimality conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Newton-Raphson method is a powerful iterative method for solving systems of nonlinear equations. Its fast convergence rate and ability to handle both nonlinear and linear equations make it a preferred method in various fields. However, it has some limitations that must be considered, such as its sensitivity to the initial guess of the solution and the computational cost of computing the Jacobian matrix. Nevertheless, the Newton-Raphson method remains an essential tool for solving nonlinear systems of equations and has a wide range of applications in many fields."
